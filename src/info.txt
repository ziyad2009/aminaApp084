 solve proplem of onsignal
 @guilhermecampossilva9 Your post saved me alot of headache, as it seems to have solved this.

Notes:

I'm using Version 4.5.0 of One Signal React Native and 0.66.4 RN.
My app was crashing immediately after launch on the simulator
I was getting a dyld__abort_with_payload error
I went to my main target and then to General > Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content
Here OneSignalNotificationServiceExtension.appex was already present.
I needed to add:
OneSignalCore.xcframework - Embed & Sign
OneSignalOutcomes.xcframework - Embed & Sign
The OneSignal folks should probably be adding this to their react-native setup documentation found here.


/// got sign in problem when using xcode 14+
Thanks for the information, it helped me to put together a solution for App Center.

This one will automatically grab the team identifier and projects:

post_install do |installer|
  # Run the React-Native post install
  react_native_post_install(installer, :mac_catalyst_enabled => false)
  __apply_Xcode_12_5_M1_post_install_workaround(installer)

  # Get the development team id from the main project
  dev_team_id = ""
  project = installer.aggregate_targets[0].user_project
  project.targets.each do |target|
    target.build_configurations.each do |config|
      if dev_team_id.empty? and !config.build_settings['DEVELOPMENT_TEAM'].nil?
        dev_team_id = config.build_settings['DEVELOPMENT_TEAM']
      end
    end
  end

  # Reconfigure the pods, update deployment target and signing settings
  installer.pods_project.targets.each do |target|
    target.build_configurations.each do |config|
      if target.respond_to?(:product_type) and target.product_type == 'com.apple.product-type.bundle'
        config.build_settings['DEVELOPMENT_TEAM'] = dev_team_id
        config.build_settings['CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY'] = 'Apple Distribution';
        config.build_settings['CODE_SIGN_STYLE'] = 'Manual';
      end if

      config.build_settings.delete 'IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET'
    end
  end
end
Note: I also remove the deployment target from the Pods projects to prevent a few warnings, but you can remove that line if you want. It is not relevant for this issue.
